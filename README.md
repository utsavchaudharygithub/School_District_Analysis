Based on the chart, average scores on reading and math wasn't much of a different . However, there was significant decerease of overall passing percentage from $645-675

# Scores based on school size
<img width="798" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 4 18 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91306158/145497480-ebfd0d5d-0208-4766-b086-97d8f145a472.png">
Looking at the given scores, it shows that school with size <1000 has overall passing percentage way high 90% compared to larger schools (2000-5000) which is only 58%
# Scores by school type
<img width="753" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-09 at 4 18 31 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91306158/145497641-286332c1-50f6-41ed-b75f-901de5d75c4e.png">
Given scores shows that Charter school has comparatively higher passing percentages pf 90% to only 54% on District.

# Conclusion
The Charter schools have very impressive results to Distict schools. and School size hampers a lot on passing percentages , could be be because students are given more attention. We suggest the school disticts to focus more on larger scale school and students. Top Performing schools are also from Charter schools which leads the district school which are bottom five performing school and students at bottom school need to focus more on Math in order to raise the percentages.
